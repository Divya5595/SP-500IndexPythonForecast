Predicting Stock Market Returns 
========

This repository contains the code for the portfolio project I've worked on at **Data Science Retreat** (Berlin).

The project aim is to build a model to predict **Stock Market Prices**, using a combination of Machine Learning Algorithms.

The output of the prediction are the daily returns of S&P-500 index.

* **Binary Classification Problem**: predict positive (**Up**) or negative (**Down**) return respect to the previous day.

The language I picked to implement the analysis is Python (numpy, scipy, pandas, matplotlib, scikit).

The main file is **markets.py**. The script calls several functions contained in the pystocks.py.
